    <h1>'Doctrine of Basic Structure'</h1>
    <p>
    <p>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Doctrine of Basic Structure: </b>It was propounded by the Indian Judiciary
            on 24th April 1973 in Keshavananda Bharati case to put a limitation on the
            amending powers of the Parliament so that the ‘basic structure of the
            basic law of the land’ cannot be amended in exercise of its ‘constituent
            power’ under the Constitution.
        </li>
        <li>
            Basic structure though is not exactly
            defined but through its contents which have been provided by the
            judicature clarifies a scope defining the frame or the structure of the
            constitution. Some of its constituents are Rule of law, Sovereignty,
            liberty and republic nature of Indian polity, judicial review, Separation
            of power, secularism, and Republic nature of India etc.
        </li>

    </ul>

    </p>
    <p>
    <h2>Body</h2>
    <h3>The development history of the doctrine of basic structure can be divided
        into following stages:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Sankari Prasad judgement 1951: Initially judiciary
            was of the view that the amendment power of the parliament is unrestricted
            because it can amend any part of the constitution, even the Article-368
            which provides the power to amend to the parliament.
        </li>
        <li>
            Golak Nath V State of
            Punjab 1967: The Supreme Court adopted a new vision to see the powers of
            parliament that it cannot amend the Part III of the constitution i.e
            Fundamental rights and thus awarded fundamental rights a “Transcendental
            Position”.
        </li>
        <li>
            Keshavanada Bharti V State of Kerala 1973: It gave birth to the
            landmark judgement which pronounced that the parliaments cannot alter or
            disturb the basic structure of the constitution. It was held that,
            however, the parliament has unfettered power to amend the constitution but
            it cannot disturb or emasculate the basic structure or fundamental
            features of the constitution as it has only the power of amendment and not
            of re-writing constitution.
        </li>
        <li>
            In Indira Nehru Gandhi v. Raj Narain and
            Minerva Mills v. Union of India, Constitution Benches of the Supreme Court
            used the basic structure doctrine to strike down the 39th Amendment and
            parts of the 42nd Amendment respectively, and paved the way for
            restoration of Indian democracy.The Supreme Court’s position on
            constitutional amendments laid out in its judgement is that Parliament can
            amend the Constitution but cannot destroy its “basic structure”.
        </li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
    <h2>Significance in strengthening democracy</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Protection from authoritarian regime: It certainly saved Indian democracy from degenerating into
            authoritarian
            regime.
        </li>
        <li>
            Independence of judiciary: It strengthens our democracy by delineating a true separation of power where
            Judiciary is independent of other two organs. It has also given immense untold unbridled power to Supreme
            Court and made it the most powerful court in the world
        </li>
        <li>
            Citizenship rights: It, by restraining the amending powers of legislative organ of State, provides basic
            Rights
            to
            Citizens which no organ of State can overrule. These rights are called Fundamental Rights.
        </li>
        <li>
            Being dynamic in nature, it is more progressive and open to changes in time unlike the rigid nature of
            earlier
            judgements.
        </li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
    <h2> Conclusion </h2>
    Even though judiciary never gave a solid test to discover what basic structure is, it however, has acted as a brake
    to
    the legislative enthusiasm of Parliament, thereby preserving the original ideals envisioned by the
    constitution-makers
    and strengthening the democracy.
